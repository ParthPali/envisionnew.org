Project enVision U.S. is proud to announce the successful launch of a Space Exploration STEM program at [Stonegate Elementary School](https://stonegate.fmsd.org/). We partnered with [QuestForSpace](http://www.questforspace.com/) to bring these kits to Stonegate and are more than excited to see what the kids will build!

Stonegate Elementary School is a Title I school located in San Jose, California. Founder Rushil Srivastava met with the school in October of 2018 to help strategize a launch for the program. Through Project enVision Inspire, Rushil launched a fundraiser to raise money for this cause.

Project enVision purchased 5 Ground Kits, Uploading Time, and Laptops for students to use.

Pictures coming soon!
