## Introduction

In our previous post, we highlighted the efforts Project enVision has been taking to address the COVID-19 Pandemic. Today, we would like to share a new initiative we have started at our organization: 3D Printing Medical Protective Gear.

Project enVision is printing 3D Face Shields, Surgical Mask Straps & more to help provide much needed medical gears to frontline medical workers. The shortage of protective equipment for our medical workers has been well documented and Project enVision would like to provide all the help it can. That's why we are dedicating $5,000 to 3D printing supplies and distributing care kits.

## Our designs

We are currently working with engineers and hospitals to continue to fine tune the designs we print. For Face Shields, we are currently utilizing the [UCSF Face Mask model](https://www.library.ucsf.edu/news/ucsf-3d-printed-face-shield-project/) and printing in PETG. For Surgical Mask Straps, we are utilizing the [NIH approved model](https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013410) and are printing in ABS. If you have suggestions on how to improve our print time or lower our material costs, [please contact us](mailto:operations@envisionnew.org).

## Where we are distributing

We are currently fulfilling individual requests and requests to the Santa Clara Valley Medical Hospital. If you represent a hospital or medical group that is in need of supplies, [please contact us](mailto:support@envisionnew.org) and we will try to get supplies to you as soon as possible.

## What we need

We are looking for the following:

- Volunteers who either have access to a 3D printer or have 3D printing experience.
- 3D Printer Access (schools, offices, libraries, etc.)
- 3D Printer Supplies Donations (PETG, ABS)
- [Monetary Donations](https://paypal.me/envisionnew)

If you may assist in any of these areas, please get in [contact with us](mailto:support@envisionnew.org).
