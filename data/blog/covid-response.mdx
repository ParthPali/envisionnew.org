These last few weeks have been anything but normal as our world reacts to COVID-19. As we live through these unprecedented times, I wanted to highlight some of the work Project enVision has done and will be doing.

## What we have done

On **March 6th, 2020**, we suspended Project enVision operations at all locations and recommended that volunteers to stay home. Only Project enVision Inspire programs were active during this time.

On **March 9th, 2020**, Project enVision sent recommendations to California Governor Gavin Newsom, California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond, and school districts regarding the impact of COVID-19 on local and educational services and concerns.

On **March 19th, 2020**, Project enVision complied with California's Stay at Home Order and required all incubated nonprofits through Project enVision Inspire to suspend direct operations indefinitely.

## What we plan to do

Our team has taken our website offline to update our new COVID-19 offerings.

**Project enVision Learn** is working to release all curriculum online and is scheduling volunteers to be available online to answer questions.

**Project enVision Tutoring** is working to release a new tutor system in which students can schedule tutor help via Zoom.

**Project enVision Inspire** is working on allocating funds to start incubating new nonprofit projects that will support the community during COVID-19. We also intend to host a competition and award funding to nonprofits building innovating solutions helping health systems and protecting vulnerable populations. We are also working with contacts to potentially secure limited health supplies to donate.

## Closing

While we navigate these uncertain times, we at Project enVision are certain that better times are ahead of us. We believe strongly in the unity and strength in community and will continue to invest our efforts in providing quality community services.

The entire team at Project enVision is super grateful for all the people working on the frontlines—from medical professionals to grocery employees—thank you for all your hard work in keeping all of us safe. You inspire all of us!

We hope you and your family stay safe. If I can be of any help, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email [rushil@envisionnew.org](mailto:rushil@envisionnew.org).
