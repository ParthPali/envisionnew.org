_Sheesh_ — it has been a while since our last blog post. Rest assured, Project enVision U.S. has been hard at work during the pandemic to make education more accessible and our **community a better place** by holding STEM classes via Zoom.

Moving into the 2021-2022 school year, Project enVision U.S. is looking for passionate minds to join in on our efforts to lead active high school volunteering. Join us in bridging the gap in education and resource availability with others your age. Through our 501(c)(3) organizational status, all hours worked with Project enVision U.S. can be officially certified.

We are looking for any volunteer — regardless of location — from the ages 13-20.

Please fill out the form located below to apply as a volunteer.
