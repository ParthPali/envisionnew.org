              A robust product strategy is a basement of building great
              products. Unfortunately, most companies fail in their product
              launch attempts because they lose track of their strategy. Let me
              show you how you can create the product strategy effectively for
              your SaaS.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you’re setting up a SaaS company, you need to build your
              strategy to grow your business. Your strategy focus will be only
              on: business strategy, marketing strategy, and sales strategy. In
              the beginning, these strategies are hard to fix. But, no matter
              what, you need to push through as they’re the critical elements
              for branding your product. While you’re figuring out your business
              model, you might have missed one thing that should be your
              priority for your business development, which is “Product
              strategy.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Having a product vision or a basic conversation with the team
              about how it works isn’t enough. For robust growth, you need to
              undergo a strong product strategy and document the whole process
              until the release is very crucial. Then, use the document as your
              bridging point.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may wonder, what is a product strategy? And what should it
              look like? In this article, I will provide you with an answer to
              these questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Product Strategy” - an elevated plan that explains clearly about
              business hopes to achieve with its product, and how to plan it to
              do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              This strategy should be able to answer the following questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What is the use-case of the product?</li>
              <li>How does it benefit those use-cases?</li>
              <li>
                What are the goals for the product you’re going to achieve
                through the product life cycle?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Accomplishing your product strategy doesn’t require a 100-slide
              PowerPoint presentation. You can make it simple by adding one page
              with required information such as,
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Product vision</li>
              <li>The direction of the product</li>
              <li>
                Milestones you want to reach for the success of your product
              </li>
              <li>Investments for your overall plan</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When creating your product strategy, it is crucial to keep this in
              mind; the action plan or roadmap you create for your product is
              different from the product strategy. Don’t confuse both.

              Why do you need a Product Strategy?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Your product strategy plays a crucial role in determining your
              product needs, and are you moving in the right direction even in
              all the toss and turns of building a SaaS product and bringing
              them to the market. Accomplishing a solid product strategy doesn’t
              just help you with your product team understanding but also to all
              the divisional teams who all need to collaborate to make sure
              they’re building a successful product that genuinely helps
              customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Suppose you skip creating a product strategy step. In that case,
              you’re at the significant risk of losing the quality customers and
              building a wrong feature that fails to provide good value to your
              customers, and ultimately, it’s a great loss for your product!
            </p>

              <strong>Product Strategy vs. Product Roadmap:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually, product strategy doesn’t include an action plan or a{' '}

              </strong>{' '}
              focused on how to develop your business or software. Instead, it
              consists of the set of coherent actions, disputes, to
              “implementation” details.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us say; you’re about to create a platform for virtual summits.
              You aim to provide people with an all-in-one planning logistic
              tool. But you’ve also added in your product roadmap the direction
              flow, aka transforming your product into software for individuals
              who want to build their online communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              All these visions should be added to your product strategy, along
              with the resources. A product roadmap also helps you define the
              exact steps you need to prepare your software for reality.
            </p>
            <p>
              A product strategy gives you an answer for your “why” and “what,”
              while a product roadmap is about your “how” and “when.” Thus, your
              product strategy helps you in designing and prioritizing your
              product roadmap.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without a product strategy to oversee these decisions, there is
              the chance of prioritizing the wrong items, which ends all team
              efforts to zero. But when you start with a product strategy, you
              will have a perfect picture of your hope to achieve with your
              product, which can translate into a more strategically sound
              product roadmap.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, I am pretty sure you will have an idea on this aspect; let’s
              look at the differences between an offensive product strategy and
              a better one.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Dreadful product strategy that won’t work:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              A good product strategy always deals with coherence, coordinating
              actions, policies, and resources to achieve success. But, many
              organizations lag in this. Instead, they have several goals and
              initiatives that symbolize progress, but no coherent approach to
              establish that progress rather than spending more a ton of time
              and trying harder.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Your strategy will not work when:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Lack of flexibility</strong>. Your product strategy is
                an underway piece of work. It doesn’t stop with just providing
                your product vision and the resources you’re likely to invest.
                It’s an open document - you’ll need to keep changing the plans
                according to the realities. Otherwise, your inflexibility may
                lead to missing great business opportunities. So, always be
                prepared for course correction.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  You are concentrating on action instead of vision
                </strong>
                . Remember, your product strategy is not an action plan. It
                should contain the idea of what direction you want to take, not
                how you want to reach your end goal.
              </li>
              <li>

                consider your needs because they’re the only hope for your
                product’s success. You can’t build your product strategy in a
                vacuum. Don’t let yourself in the risk of developing the wrong
                products.

            <p>
              As I mentioned earlier, creating a product strategy will
              continuously require the amount of time and precise analysis of
              your vision, target audience, resources, and business atmosphere.
              It may sound a bit intimidating and daunting, especially if you’re

              for your product, you probably have several ideas to succeed.
              Before undergoing your product strategy, take a look at your
              vision, and remove all the unwanted fluff, removing all the ideas
              that you feel will not work. Instead, just focus on the
              essentials. Choose the prominent things which help to gain success
              when building the product, decide what needs to be created, and
              start working on this framework.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your product strategy should be flexible. It’s crucial to have a
              clear structure based on a good vision that will help you keep
              your focus on the right path. So, don’t waste your precious time
              by adding more and more unwanted fluffs to your excellent product
              vision. Instead, decide what is important and focus on that one
              thing.

              Get to know your stakeholders’ ecosystem, and by that, you can
              determine the leading target group and prioritize your roadmap.
              After that, you can also look around and identify your internal or
              external stakeholders, your industry partners, key influencers,
              investors, the C-Suite team, the industry media, and your
              audience. Take all of those lists and identify their needs and
              prioritize them separately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Form your relational ecosystem that leads your product vision to
              success. To determine your influential stakeholders, you’ll need
              to answer the following questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What is my business?</li>
              <li>Whom do I create a platform?</li>
              <li>Who can help me achieve my end goals?</li>
              <li>Whom do I need to add to my team?</li>
              <li>Who is best to discuss the ideas?</li>

              suggest you write this product statement because it will help you
              find answers to these questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What solution does your product work for?</li>
              <li>How it helps customers to find what they need?</li>
              <li>
                How your solution is unique and easier than your competitor?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              While developing a product strategy, if any of those questions
              stop you, it’s probably a good idea to question yourself here
              “What stops to position your product?” To find the correct
              solution you may need to revisit the prior steps of your product
              strategy and resolve the issue.

              4. Get to know the value the proposition for your product
            </h3>
            <p>
              Your product is more worth than just features and solutions. Your
              SaaS product is a software/tool that someone can use to achieve
              their desired outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
              The value proposition of your product refers to a “unique
              identifier” which means you have the unique value where your
              customers get from your product where your competitors can’t
              solve! It is a crucial thing that defines why your customers work
              you over your competitors.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve the value proposition for your product, you need to
              dive deeper into the problems you want to solve for people and the
              impact your product gives. So, make sure to derive the results of
              this analysis as part of your product strategy.

                </a>
              </strong>
              ? To achieve this, you should build the right product at the right
              time, analyze which product is most needed among your customer,
              and build the road map for it. If you’re building a product on
              your own without considering a demand, then it’s not a good idea.
              The way for your company to succeed is to develop a product whose
              unique proposition satisfies the needs of a market and its
              potential customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other side, the product/market fit involves determining
              target customers and serving them with the right product or
              solution. When you’re up to design your product strategy, make
              sure that your product vision is perfectly aligned with the market
              needs.

              6. List your product unique components/elements:

            <ul>
              <li>What makes your product unique from your competitors?</li>
              <li>Why should your audience buy it from you?</li>
              <li>What are your unique elements?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The overall idea of developing a product strategy is about
              identifying your product strengths and generating opportunities.
              One way to do that is by determining all those unique elements
              that make your product more powerful, creating a sharpened needle
              for your company’s success and better than what can be found on
              the market.
            </p>
            <p>
              You need to have a great understanding of the overall market at
              your fingertip and be aware of the ubiquitous characteristics that
              set your product apart. Moreover, when designing your product
              strategy, make sure that these unique elements are meaningful for
              your target group.

              7. State your product goals and objectives clearly
            </h3>
            <p>
              When you have a clear idea of how your product will help your
              customers, the next step you need to analyze how uniquely you
              carry through on that value, setting up neat product goals will
              help you determine whether you’re moving with your product
              strategy or drifting apart. Naturally, your goals may differ over
              time; you may be concentrated on brand growth and engagement in
              the starting stage of your product. As time evolves, you have
              vital goals like increasing revenue, customer experience, etc. But
              your goals should not leave track of your product vision.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Once you’ve fixed the solid goals and objectives, you should
              establish the KPI for all those goals. This will keep you on track
              to executing all the goals of your product strategy successfully.
              These KPIs are nothing but performance metrics, adoption metrics,
              growth goals, etc. It’s crucial to improve these metrics in this
              phase. KPIs are an accurate way of knowing how well your product
              strategy works.

            </h3>
            <p>
              A robust product strategy never fails to offer you a long-term
              vision regarding your product’s growth, expansion, and eventual
              decline. After all, just be prepared for the last phases of your
              SaaS product. So, while designing your strategy, it’s crucial to
              answer all the following questions.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>How long will your product evolve?</li>
              <li>What are all the risks?</li>
              <li>What are the factors that will challenge your status quo?</li>
              <li>What are the possible decline scenarios?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Answering these questions will help you to be prepared and
              know-how to adapt your entire strategy. No matter how long is the
              life cycle for your product.

              and build a roadmap without undergoing a product strategy. That’s
              why you’ll want to start your research journey for your product by
              getting serious about your product vision, stripping away the
              unnecessary ideas, and leaving the crucial components.

            <p>
              Also, listing all of your stakeholders, knowing your assets, what
              your product use-case(persona) is, and who can help you to reach
              your end goals. Next, write your product statement and determine
              your value proposition; this allows you to know the actual
              problems your product will solve. Also, be sure to take measures
              for the product/market fit because if you don’t, you run the risk
              of creating a product wrong.

            <p>
              Finally, the unique element that will strengthen your product
              strategy is to assess the resources and investments in making your
              vision a reality. Never forget to set goals and track them; it is
              the only way to know your progress. I hope these product strategy
              steps will help you build a robust plan that’s powerful enough to
              guide you from slipping through the cracks.
